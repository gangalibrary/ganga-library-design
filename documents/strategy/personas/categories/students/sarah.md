## Background

> I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, can you help me?

While Sarah is not yet in college, she occasionally uses the library for information needed to complete her assignments. She and other casual users of the library, such as members of the local community or amateur historians, use the library rarely and lack confidence in an academic environment.

Sarah has worked in 4-H for many years, as both a student member and a leader. She has admired many of her mentors throughout the years.  When she thinks of her future, she knows she would like to be involved in developing and promoting ag programs in schools and communities.  She feels she would be building on skills she has already developed.  During her high school years she was also been involved in several environmental causes.  These experiences have helped her to recognize the need for greater awareness of agricultural and environmental impacts.

Sarah feels that the skills she learns in her degree program will transfer to a number of different fields.  She is aware that she is not confined to taking classes in her major, but can expand her focus according to her interests. Her advisor has been very helpful, and Sarah feels confident that she will be a guiding force in the future.   

Sarah lives with her parents. She has her own smartphone and uses IM, text messaging, and email to communicate with friends. She appreciates the support that she finds in her major.  She was surprised at how approachable the faculty are; questions and difficulties can be cleared up without too much anxiety.  Though shy, she is surprised at how easy it is to make friends. She is beginning to feel more confident and  is excited about everything that she has learned.

## User Stories

1. Sarah has a class assignment to write a short research paper for History. Her instructor requires the following sources: one scholarly article, one book source, and one internet source. She is not sure where to begin!
2. Sarah is working in her dorm room at 2:00 AM and needs some peer-reviewed articles for her Communications 101 assignment. She is not sure what that term means or how to go about finding out. She heard that she can access the library web site from her dorm room so she hopes she can find some articles online.
3. Sarah would like to learn how to use the library more effectively. She feels frustrated about how difficult finding sources for her assignments seems to be - things are much different from high school! She wonders how to get more help and might even be interested in taking a library research class if there was one.
